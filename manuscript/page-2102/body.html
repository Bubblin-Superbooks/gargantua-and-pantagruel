<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">that dreadful hour is come,
That thou in hell receiv’st thy doom,
E’en there, I know, thou’lt play some trick,
And Proserpine shan’t scape a prick
Of the long pin within thy breeches.
But when thou’rt using these capriches,
And caterwauling in her cavern,
Send Pluto to the farthest tavern
For the best wine that’s to be had,
Lest he should see, and run horn-mad.
She’s kind, and ever did admire
A well-fed monk or well-hung friar.</p><p>Go to, quoth Friar John, thou old noddy, thou doddipolled ninny, go to the devil thou’rt prating of. I’ve done with rhyming; the rheum gripes me at the gullet. Let’s talk of paying and going; come.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
