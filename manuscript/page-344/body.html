Gargantua finding himself somewhat dry, asked whether they could get any lettuce to make him a salad; and hearing that there were the greatest and fairest in the country, for they were as great as plum-trees or as walnut-trees, he would go thither himself, and brought thence in his hand what he thought good, and withal carried away the six pilgrims, who were in so great fear that they did not dare to speak nor cough.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Washing them, therefore, first at the fountain, the pilgrims said one to another softly, What shall we do?</p></div> </div>
