It was a wonderful machine, so contrived that, by means of large engines that were round about it in rows, it throw’d forked iron bars and four-squared steel bolts; and in its hold two hundred men at least could easily fight, and be sheltered. It was made after the model of the sow of Riole, by the means of which Bergerac was retaken from the English in the reign of Charles the Sixth.</p><p>Here are the names of the noble and valiant cooks who went into the sow, as the Greeks did into the Trojan horse:</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Sour-sauce. Crisp-pig. Carbonado. Sweet-meat.</p></div> </div>
