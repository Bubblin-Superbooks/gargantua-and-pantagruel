For one day by chance I happened to read a chapter of them at Poictiers, at the most decretalipotent Scotch doctor’s, and old Nick turn me into bumfodder, if this did not make me so hide-bound and costive, that for four or five days I hardly scumbered one poor butt of sir-reverence; and that, too, was full as dry and hard, I protest, as Catullus tells us were those of his neighbour Furius:</p><p>Nec toto decies cacas in anno,

Non unquam digitum inquinare posses.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Oh, ho! cried Homenas; by’r lady, it may be you were then in the state of mortal sin, my friend. Well</p></div> </div>
