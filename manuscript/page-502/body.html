And believe me, upon mine honour, they at his request went to her burial and funeral obsequies. In the meanwhile, poor Gargantua staying at home, and willing to have somewhat in remembrance of her to be engraven upon her tomb, made this epitaph in the manner as followeth.</p><p>Dead is the noble Badebec,

And did decease at my bedside,
The year and day in which she died.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
