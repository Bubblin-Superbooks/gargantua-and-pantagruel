Long as my baws can on her bum beat.
O what a battle of a— fighting
Will there be, which I much delight in!
What pleasing pains then shall I take
To keep myself and spouse awake!
All heart and juice, I’ll up and ride,
And make a duchess of my bride.
Sing Io paean! loudly sing
To Hymen, who all joys will bring.
Well, Friar John, I’ll take my oath,
This oracle is full of troth;
Intelligible truth it bears,
More certain than the sieve and shears.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
