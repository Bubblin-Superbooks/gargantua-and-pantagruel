And, save the codpiece, all in armour dight,
My dear, she cried, why, pray, of all the rest
Is that exposed, you know I love the best?

Or rather pious, conscionable care?
Wise lady, she!  In hurlyburly fight,
Can any tell where random blows may light?</p><p>Leave off then, sir, from being astonished, and wonder no more at this new manner of decking and trimming up of myself as you now see me.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
