Then, in imitation of Pantagruel’s verses and trophy, wrote that which followeth:—</p><p>Here was it that four jovial blades sat down
To a profound carousing, and to crown
Their banquet with those wines which please best great
Bacchus, the monarch of their drinking state.

With salt and vinegar, displayed there,
Of which to snatch a bit or two at once
They all fell on like hungry scorpions.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">For th’ Inventories
