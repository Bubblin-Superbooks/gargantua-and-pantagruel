Transform my bum, by power divine,
Into a lantern, that may light
My neighbour in the darkest night.</p><p>Panurge then proceeds in his rapture, and says:</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">From Pythian Tripos ne’er were heard
More truths, nor more to be revered.
I think from Delphos to this spring
Some wizard brought that conjuring thing.
Had honest Plutarch here been toping,
He then so long had ne’er been groping
To find, according to his wishes,
Why oracles are mute as fishes
At Delphos.  Now the reason’s clear;
No more at Delphos they’re, but here.
Here is the tripos, out of which
Is spoke the doom of poor and rich.
For Athenaeus does relate
This Bottle is the Womb of Fate;
Prolific of mysterious wine,
And big with prescience divine,
It brings the truth with pleasure forth;
Besides you ha’t a pennyworth.
So, Friar John, I must exhort you
To wait a word that may import you,
