Didst Thou Ever Hear The Vulgar Proverb, Happy Is The Physician Whose Coming Is Desired At The Declension Of A Disease? For The Sickness Being Come To A Crisis Is Then Upon The Decreasing Hand, And Drawing Towards An End, Although The Physician Should Not Repair Thither For The Cure Thereof; Whereby, Though Nature Wholly Do The Work, He Bears Away The Palm And Praise Thereof. My Pleaders, After The Same Manner, Before I Did Interpose My Judgment In The Reconciling Of Them, Were Waxing Faint In Their Contestations. Their Altercation Heat Was Much Abated, And, In Declining From Their Former Strife, They Of Themselves Inclined To A Firm Accommodation Of Their Differences; Because There Wanted Fuel To That Fire Of Burning Rancour And Despiteful Wrangling Whereof The Lower Sort Of Lawyers Were The Kindlers. That Is To Say, Their Purses Were Emptied Of Coin, They Had Not A Win In Their Fob, Nor Penny In Their Bag, Wherewith To Solicit And Present Their Actions.</h4></div> </div>
