And his gambadoes, I’ll never do’t.
No man that knows me e’er shall judge
I mean to make myself a drudge;
Or that pilgarlic e’er will dote
Upon a paltry petticoat.
I’ll ne’er my liberty betray
All for a little leapfrog play;

Great Alexander for my wife,
Nor Pompey, nor his dad-in-law,
Who did each other clapperclaw.
Not the best he that wears a head
Shall win me to his truckle-bed.</p><p>Panurge, pulling off his gaberdine and mystical accoutrements, replied:</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Wherefore thou shalt, thou filthy beast,
Be damned twelve fathoms deep at least;
While I shall reign in Paradise,
